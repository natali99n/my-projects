# Hi, I'm Natalia ðŸ‘‹
I am a graduate of the Technical University of Kosice and I am passionately interested in programming and software development.   
I would be happy to join a reputable company as a junior developer and gain practical experience in this dynamic field.

During my studies, I was heavily involved in programming and gained a foundation in languages such as Python, HTML/CSS, SQL, C and JavaScript/JSX. 
I had experience with developing web applications using Wordpress and Tilda, as well as using React.js and Express.js.
